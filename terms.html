      <h3>Shipping Policies</h3>
      <p>Businesses using Razorpay will have their own shipping policies that detail how they handle shipping, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shipping Costs:</strong> How much it costs to ship the product.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery Time:</strong> How long it takes to receive the order after payment.</li>
        <li><strong>Shipping Methods:</strong> How the product is shipped (e.g., courier service, postal service).</li>
        <li><strong>Shipping Restrictions:</strong> Any limitations on where they ship (e.g., domestic vs. international).</li>
        <li><strong>Order Tracking:</strong> Whether customers can track their shipments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In summary: Razorpay is a payment gateway, not a shipping provider. Businesses using Razorpay will have their own shipping policies to manage the delivery of products purchased through the platform.</p>

      <h3>Refunds and Cancellations</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Contact the Seller:</strong> Find the seller's contact information (usually on their website or in the payment confirmation email). Explain your reason for requesting a cancellation or refund.</li>
        <li><strong>Refund Process (If Approved by Seller):</strong> Sellers can issue refunds directly from their Razorpay Dashboard or via API. Razorpay supports instant refunds and refund tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation Process (If Approved by Seller):</strong> Sellers can cancel unpaid payment links or refund already paid transactions.</li>
        <li><strong>If Seller is Unresponsive:</strong> Allow 7–10 business days (physical goods) or 1 day (digital goods). If unresolved, contact your bank to raise a dispute. Razorpay will coordinate with banks.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Note:</em> Razorpay is a payment processor; refund and cancellation requests must be initiated with the seller.</p>
